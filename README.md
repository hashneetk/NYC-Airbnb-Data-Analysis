**Project Description**<br/><br/>
This is a repository for my final class project, Introduction to Data Science at UCLA Extension.
Airbnb is a trusted online marketplace for people to list, discover, and book unique accommodations and experiences around the world. Since it's launch in 2008, Airbnb has become world's largest community driven hospitality company offering homes & experiences. Be it the analysis of the data for security purposes or to drive more sales, Airbnb has millions of tons of data to analyse. 

This dataset provides the details of the listings of different kinds of accommodations across different NYC neighbourhoods in the year 2019. It also lists down all the hosts and the rate of occupancy of each listing.I have designed a model to predict the price of a particular kind of accomodation based on the neighborhood.
